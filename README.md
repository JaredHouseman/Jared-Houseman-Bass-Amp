## Current Status
Initial proposal

## Project Overview
I would like to build a tube amplifier inspired by a Sunn 200s. I wish to build an amplifer suited for both live preformace and studio use.
I am aiming for roughly 60w of output while having low self noise.

## Educational Value Added
The educational value of doing this project would include a better understanding of filters and amplifiers, high voltage safety, 
and how to optimize the physical layout of a circuit.

This project would also require extensive learning about vaccume tubes, a subject not includeing in the normal curiculum, and transformers.
